# Collatz

Quick hack of the Collatz conjecture in Ada just using the default integer size.

I'm not a fan of the GPL, but it's licensed this way as I'm using GNAT Community and it states "This compiler and toolchain are intended for creating software which will be licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3."
